name: Tests

# Testing Strategy:
# - Tests run on Linux, macOS, and Windows (cross-platform library)
# - MATLAB .mat files are cross-platform - must work everywhere
# - Go 1.25+ required (matches go.mod requirement)
# - Depends on github.com/scigolib/hdf5 for v7.3+ format support
#
# Branch Strategy (Git Flow):
# - feature/** branches: Development work
# - release/** branches: Pre-release testing (test here BEFORE merging to main)
# - develop branch: Integration branch
# - main branch: Production-ready code only (protected)
# - Pull requests: Must pass all tests before merge
